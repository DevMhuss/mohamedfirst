<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>At 21, I'm a travel enthusiast and Arabic student who thrives on exploring new cultures. When I'm not studying the language, I'm kicking a football on the field, fueled by teamwork and competition. Passionate about broadening my horizons, I embrace every opportunity for adventure and connection.</p>
<p>I grew a keen interest in coding after trying out uni (I was previously in accounting). I noticed that everything around me was diverting towards tech which influeneced me and made me make a change.</p>
